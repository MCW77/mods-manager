Some characters have multiple different targets that you can select from.",

        "4": "The easiest way to get started with the optimizer is to choose from the pre-programmed character templates. These are set up with sets of characters and targets that should fit various game modes. If there's no template to fit your exact needs, you can use one as a starting point or create one from scratch. For each individual character, if no target exists that matches what you want, you can select \"Custom\", or simply hit the \"Edit\" button to bring up the character edit modal."
      },
      "5": {
        "Headline": "Picking target values",
        "1": "Most characters will have the \"basic\" mode selected by default. In basic mode, you select a value for all stats that is between -100 and 100. These values are weights that are assigned to each stat to determine its impoact for that character. Setting two values as equal means that those stats are about equally important for that character. In basic mode, the optimizer will automatically adjust the weights to fit the range of values seen in-game for that stat. For example, giving speed and protection both a value of 100 means that 1 speed is about equivalent to 200 protection (since you find much more protection on mods than you do speed).",
        "2": "If you want more fine-tuned control over the stat values, you can switch to \"advanced\" mode. In advanced mode, the values given are the value for each point of the listed stat. In advanced mode, if speed and protection are both given a value of 100, then the tool will never select speed, because it can more easily give that character much more protection. I suggest sticking to basic mode until you have a strong sense for how the tool works."
